# Landing Page Project

This project is focused on building a dynamic and responsive landing page. The core functionality is implemented in JavaScript, with `app.js` being the main file where the interactive elements and behaviors are defined. The goal of this project is to enhance the user experience by dynamically updating the content and structure of the web page as the user interacts with it.

## Features

- **Dynamic Navigation Bar**: Automatically updates based on the sections present in the page.
- **Scroll to Section**: Smooth scrolling to sections when navigation links are clicked.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: Highlights the section in viewport in the navigation bar and on the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the page looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SVG
